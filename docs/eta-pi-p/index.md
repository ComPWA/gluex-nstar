## Amplitude Analysis 101 / PWA101 (v2.0)

### CAS-assisted Amplitude Models building for photoproduction reaction

This document is a follow-up of PWA101 (v1.0), see **[TR&#8209;033](https://compwa.github.io/report/033)**.

The tutorial has been split into separate notebooks and the amplitude model is instead formulated using CAS-assisted (Computer Algebra System) model building using [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) and the [ComPWA packages](https://compwa.github.io/).

In the following, an attempt to manually formulate the amplitude model via Sympy is shown.
Later on, attempts of automated amplitude model formualtion are done via e.g. `ampform` and `ampform-dpd`.
