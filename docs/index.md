# Amplitude Analysis 101 / PWA101 (v2.0)

## CAS-assisted Amplitude Models building for photoproduction reaction

This document is a follow-up of PWA101 (v1.0) (temporarily see [here](https://compwa--217.org.readthedocs.build/report/999.html)),
as an introduction to Amplitude Analysis / Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) by demonstrating its application to a specific reaction channel and amplitude model.

Now the focus is the use of symbolic expressions (computations), with the use of [ComPWA packages](https://compwa.github.io/), or CAS(Computer Algebra System)-assisted model building in general (the python package `SymPy` in this case) to illustrate the general process in PWA.

This tutorial aims to equip readers with deeper understanding of PWA methodologies and full workflow in the context of hadron physics through a practical, hands-on example with symbolic expressions via [ComPWA](https://compwa.github.io/).

Furthermore,
address to the issue âœ…&nbsp;[ComPWA/gluex-nstar#1](https://github.com/ComPWA/gluex-nstar/issues/1), this document is PWA101(v2.0), which shows PWA methodologies and full workflow in the context of hadron physics with symbolic expressions via [ComPWA](https://compwa.github.io/).
