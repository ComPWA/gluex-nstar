# Symbolic Amplitude Models with $N^*$ Resonances at GlueX

:::{title} Welcome
:::

We are doing amplitude analysis and Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) with [CAS-assisted model building](https://compwa.github.io/symbolics), which is a technique employed in the ComPWA project.

- One demonstration example is:<br>
  $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*) $\to \eta \pi^0 p$
- The main focus of this research would be:<br>
  $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*, K\*) $\to K^+ \pi^0 \Lambda$

This research project focuses on developing and applying amplitude models to analyze data from the GlueX experiment, specifically targeting $N^*$ and $K^*$ resonances.
