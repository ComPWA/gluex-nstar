# Symbolic Amplitude Models with N-Star Resonances in the GlueX Experiment

This repository is under active development.

We are doing amplitude analysis and Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) with the use of symbolic expressions, which is included in the ComPWA packages, or CAS(Computer Algebra System)-assisted model building in general (the python package SymPy in this case).

The first demonstration example is: $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*) $\to \eta \pi^0 p$

The main focus of this research would be: $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*, K\*) $\to K^+ \pi^0 \Lambda$

Current long-term plan: This research project focuses on developing and applying amplitude models to analyze data from the GlueX experiment, specifically targeting N-star (N*) and K-star (K*) resonances.
