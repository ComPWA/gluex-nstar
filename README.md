## $N^*$ Resonances at GlueX

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is under active development.

We are doing amplitude analysis and Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) with [CAS-assisted model building](https://compwa.github.io/symbolics), which is a technique employed in the ComPWA project.

- The first demonstration example is:<br>
  $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*) $\to \eta \pi^0 p$
- The main focus of this research would be:<br>
  $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*, K\*) $\to K^+ \pi^0 \Lambda$

Current long-term plan: This research project focuses on developing and applying amplitude models to analyze data from the GlueX experiment, specifically targeting $N^\*$ and $K^\*$ resonances.
