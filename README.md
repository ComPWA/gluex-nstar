# Research project on amplitude models for N-star and other resonances in the GlueX experiment

This repository is under active development.

We are doing amplitude analysis / Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) with the use of symbolic expressions, which is included in the `ComPWA` packages, or CAS(Computer Algebra System)-assisted model building in general (the python package `SymPy` in this case).

The first demonstration example is: $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*) $\to \eta \pi^0 p$

The main focus of this research would be: $p \gamma \to$ Resonances (e.g. N\*) $\to K^+ \pi^0 \Lambda$

(More information to be added...)
